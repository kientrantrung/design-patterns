This project contains examples from the book Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software, GoF.
I reimplemented those examples in JAVA (with some slight changes to make them really runable). 
The purpose is to make it useful for people who are familiar with JAVA but not with C++.
The project is ready to be imported in Eclipse.
